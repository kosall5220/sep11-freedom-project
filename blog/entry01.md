# Entry 1
##### 10/28/24

### Context
In my SEP11 class, my teacher gave me the opportunity to create anything I want using javascript and a third-party JS tool. My current task is to decide what I want to make and plan out the process for completing this project.

### What will I make?

For the “Freedom Project”, I want to make a web application designed to help users preserve their memories and thoughts for the future.

#### Some of the features I thought of so far:
* Memory Entries:
    * Users can make entries to document significant life events, thoughts, or feelings.
 Users could revisit past entries to reflect on growth
* Future Messages:
    * Users can write messages to themselves or loved ones to be delivered on a specific date in the future.

#### Benefits of this project
* Promotes reflection and personal growth.
* Preserves the memories or experiences of the user.
